# Roadmap: Local Port Dashboard

## Milestone: v1.0 — Core Dashboard + Packaging

### Phase 1: Core Dashboard (COMPLETE)

**Goal:** Working dashboard that displays local ports with process details and one-click kill

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE — All core requirements validated in existing code

**Requirements:** CORE-01, CORE-02, CORE-03, CORE-04, CORE-05, MGMT-01, MGMT-02, MGMT-03, UI-01, UI-02, UI-03

**Success Criteria:**
1. User can see all non-system listening ports with port number, process name, PID, and protocol
2. User can toggle system process visibility
3. User can search/filter by port, process name, or PID
4. User can kill a process with confirmation and see success/error toast
5. Stats show active port count and unique process count

**Verification:** All requirements validated against existing `server.js` and `public/index.html`

### Phase 2: Electron Packaging & CLI

**Goal:** Package as distributable Electron desktop app with CLI entry point

**Requirements:** PKG-01, PKG-02

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE — All UAT tests passed

**Plans:** 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 02-01-PLAN.md — Dynamic port config and error handling
- [x] 02-02-PLAN.md — CLI entry point and electron-builder config

**Success Criteria:**
1. `npm start` launches Electron window with dashboard
2. `local-port-dashboard` CLI command opens the app
3. App can be built for Windows/macOS/Linux via electron-builder
4. No build errors or missing dependencies

**UI hint:** yes — Electron main process needs to be created

### Phase 3: Cross-Platform Support → CLI-Only Simplification

**Goal:** Support macOS and Linux alongside Windows

**Requirements:** PLAT-01

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE — Simplified to zero-dependency CLI

**Decision:** Removed Electron/web dashboard, now pure CLI tool

**Plans:** 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 03-01-PLAN.md — Cross-platform port detection and process killing
- [x] CLI simplification — zero dependencies, npx-ready

**Success Criteria:**
1. ✅ Port detection works on macOS (lsof equivalent)
2. ✅ Port detection works on Linux (/proc/net or ss equivalent)
3. ✅ Process kill works on all three platforms
4. ✅ System process filtering adapts per platform
5. ✅ No platform-specific crashes or errors
6. ✅ CLI works on all platforms with TTY detection
7. ✅ npx portman works without installation
8. ✅ Zero dependencies
9. ✅ Localhost filtering by default (dev-focused)

### Phase 4: Enhanced Features

**Goal:** Add UDP detection and auto-refresh

**Requirements:** PLAT-02, PLAT-03

**Success Criteria:**
1. UDP ports appear in dashboard alongside TCP
2. Auto-refresh toggle in UI (default: off)
3. Configurable refresh interval (5s, 10s, 30s)
4. No performance degradation during auto-refresh

---

### Phase 5: UI Enhancements — Hide & Widget Mode

**Goal:** Per-process hide option and desktop widget mode for always-on-top monitoring

**Requirements:** UI-04, UI-05

**Success Criteria:**
1. Each process row has a hide button that removes it from view
2. Hidden processes persist across refreshes (localStorage)
3. Widget mode toggle makes app compact, borderless, always-on-top
4. Widget mode can be toggled from tray menu and UI header
